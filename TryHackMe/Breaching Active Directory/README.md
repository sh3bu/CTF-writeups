## Task 1 : Introduction to AD Breaches

- Before we can exploit AD misconfigurations for privilege escalation, lateral movement, and goal execution, we need initial access first. You need to acquire an initial set of valid **AD credentials**.
- Due to the number of AD services and features, the attack surface for gaining an initial set of AD credentials is usually significant.

### Techniques to recover AD credentials in this room -

1. NTLM Authenticated Services
2. LDAP Bind Credentials
3. Authentication Relays
4. Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
5. Configuration Files
